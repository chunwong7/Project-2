Background
This is a visualization project. The hopes of this project are to visually display the impact of weather conditions on US Traffic Accidents using two available data sets from Kaggle. 
Proposed Work
Extract: We plan to use the following datasets of US accidents and weather data from Kaggle.

•	US Accidents - (Kaggle) - https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

•	Historical Hourly Weather Data -(Kaggle) - https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data

Transform: Connect data for date range between February 2016 and December 2017. This is the date overlap of the data sets indicated above.

Load: Load data into database.
